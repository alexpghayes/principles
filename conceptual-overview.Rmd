# Conceptual overview of modelling

- what is a model: models, estimands, estimators and model specifications
- what do we do with models
- how do fit models
- once we have a fit model, how do we predict or do inference

- the difference between working with a single fit vs a set of fits. LASSO example: wanting to use the coefficients for prediction vs wanting to see the order in which features enter the model
