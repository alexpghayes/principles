# principles

I didn't have enough patience to wait for Max to make a `tidymodels/principles` repo, so I made this outline and filled in the smattering of notes I have.


Things I think we need to understand and treat as separate throughout:

- programmatic versus interactive modelling
- end goal of inference versus end goal of prediction
- a single fit versus a set of fits

Other things to do:

- decide on some canonical modelling examples. proposals:
  - LASSO for a model specification with structure hyperparameter space
  - random forest for a model specification with unstructured hyperparameter space
