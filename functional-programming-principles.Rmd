# Functional programming principles

calls to fit should be pure: i.e. no side effects like plotting, and especially no plotting with invisible object return
- side effects: useful in interactive mode, irritating in programmatic mode

- type safety, particularly of returned objects
- type safety with respect to single fits vs sets of fits
