# Workflow

## Prediction

1. feature engineering
2. ML wizardry
3. more feature engineering
4. ???
5. predictions

## Inference

1. Clean data
2. Specify model
3. Fit model
4. Check that model fitting process converged / worked
5. Check statistical assumptions of model


KEY part that always gets left out: working with multiple modellings
