# Danger Zone

little things to include somewhere:
  - the danger of misspecified arguments disappearing into `...`
  
don't give your model `lm` class and count on other stuff to magically work. your should implement methods specifically for your class, and if that is just wrapping lm internals, great, but take explicit control

provide an example of extensive formula tests:
include a log term in tests to catch formula edge cases


## Anti-patterns

### the documentation that isn't documentation and doesn't feature an actual use case

*cough* `?MASS::predict.rlm` *cough*


### Never use missing arguments

because people have to write more code to pass the objects they want

predict(m) and predict(m, newdata = NULL) should do the same thing
you should test this


### special casing everything through one workhorse function instead of using S3 methods

basically `augment_columns`

don't funnel everything through augment_columns and add special cases slowly - v hard to maintain. much better to have individualized S3 methods with *consistent behavior* abstracted out into small helpers.

## Things to be aware of

If you call things `data` or `df` and users fail to specify data arguments, R will try and perform dataframe operations on the *functions* `data` and `df`. The resulting error messages for this can be cryptic. In this case you may wish to write an informative error message with a hint:

```
Error: Can't *do data frame thing* on a function.
Are you sure you passed a tibble to *argument*?
```
